# SwarmPlug

SwarmPlug is a plug-and-play connectivity layer for ROS1-based multi-agent systems,
designed to enable decentralized association, introspection, and coordination across heterogeneous robotic swarms.

🚩 This repository is a public demo & timestamp anchor for SwarmPlug ver0.1.
It demonstrates core capabilities and interfaces, without exposing the commercial core implementation.

## 1. What does SwarmPlug do?

SwarmPlug focuses on one fundamental problem in swarm robotics:

How can multiple ROS-based agents, running independent ROS masters on different devices, discover each other and share selected ROS interfaces in a decentralized way?

SwarmPlug provides:

A lightweight association layer between devices

Unified introspection of swarm-wide ROS entities

A simple CLI interface to inspect swarm state

No cloud, no central server, no monolithic ROS master.

2. What ver0.1 proves

This ver0.1 demo validates the following capabilities:

✅ Cross-device association between multiple ROS1 nodes

✅ Swarm-wide discovery of:

ROS nodes

ROS topics

ROS parameters

✅ Command-line introspection of swarm state

✅ End-to-end “hello world” topic exchange across devices

This version focuses on connectivity and observability, not on control or task logic.

3. Repository scope
Included in this repository

📄 Documentation and usage examples

🧩 High-level architecture description

🖥 CLI command demonstrations

🕒 Public release timestamp (ver0.1)

Not included in this repository

❌ Core synchronization algorithms

❌ Commercial SwarmPlug implementation

❌ Protocol adapters and internal optimizations

❌ Appliance / firmware images

This separation is intentional and aligns with the commercial roadmap.

4. Architecture overview (high level)

SwarmPlug runs locally on each device, alongside the local ROS master.

Each instance:

Interfaces with its local ROS graph

Participates in a decentralized association process

Exposes a unified swarm view through a CLI

```
5. CLI demo (ver0.1)

The following commands illustrate the ver0.1 demo behavior.

List swarm members
```bash
swarmplug nodes
```
List visible ROS topics across the swarm
```bash

swarmplug topics

```
Echo a topic from the swarm
```bash
swarmplug echo /topic1
```

List ROS parameters discovered in the swarm
```bash
swarmplug parameters

```
Read a specific parameter
```bash
swarmplug echo /turtlesim/background_b

```
These commands allow developers to inspect swarm state without manually logging into each device.

6. Typical demo scenario

A minimal demonstration setup may include:

Device A: ROS1 node publishing /topic1

Device B: SwarmPlug-enabled node associated with A

Device C: Another ROS1 node joining later

After association:

All participating devices can observe selected ROS entities

CLI commands return a swarm-consistent view

This validates decentralized discovery and visibility.

7. Current status

Public demo release: ver0.1

Focus: association & introspection

Next milestone: ver0.2 (feature expansion & stability improvements)

The roadmap prioritizes robustness, modularity, and compatibility with heterogeneous robotic platforms.

8. License & usage

This repository is provided for demonstration and evaluation purposes only.

Commercial use of SwarmPlug core requires authorization
